**Woohoo Labs. Yang is a PHP framework which helps you to communicate with JSON API servers.**

## Introduction

[JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification
[reached 1.0 on 29th May 2015](http://www.programmableweb.com/news/new-json-api-specification-aims-to-speed-api-development/2015/06/10)

JSON API client implementations.
